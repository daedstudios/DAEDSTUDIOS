## Introduction

Narastay is a forward-thinking co-living space designed for digital nomads and entrepreneurs seeking connection and inspiration. When they approached AE Studios, their goal was clear: to build a cohesive brand identity and digital platform that would resonate with their target audience and transform their spaces from traditional accomodation into the new concept of co-living. We took on the challenge, delivering a distinctive logo, strong
branding elements, and a user-friendly website to bring their vision to life.

## The Challenge

Narastay’s ambition was to stand out in the competitive co-living market by appealing to young professionals who value design, community, and purpose. They needed:

1. A **memorable logo** that encapsulated their values of openness, connection, and ambition.
2. A **brand identity** that reflected their adventurous and ambitious target demographic seeking genuine connection.
3. A **website** that serves as both a marketing tool and a platform for seamless bookings and inquiries.

## Our Approach

At AE Studios, we believe in combining technical expertise with creative insight. For Narastay, we focused on crafting a brand that was as functional as it was visually compelling.

### Logo Design: Minimalist approach

The **Narastay** logo embraces a minimalist and intentional design, subtly integrating elements that reflect openness and connection. 

The **custom typography** moves away from conventional fonts, creating a distinct, modern identity. A small circular **doorknob** inside the **‘n’** symbolizes **accessibility and openness**, reinforcing the brand’s welcoming nature. 

Balanced geometric shapes and structured spacing ensure visual harmony, while the angled **‘stay’** suggests movement and flexibility—mirroring the transient yet rooted lifestyle Narastay supports. 

This refined, modern design subtly communicates the essence of **co-living, connection, and a space designed for the new generation of urban dwellers**.
