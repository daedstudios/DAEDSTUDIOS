## Introduction

Narastay is a forward-thinking co-living space designed for digital nomads and entrepreneurs seeking connection and inspiration. When they approached AE Studios, their goal was clear: to build a cohesive brand identity and digital platform that would resonate with their target audience. Our team took on the challenge, delivering a distinctive logo, strong branding elements, and a user-friendly website to bring their vision to life.

## The Challenge

Narastay’s ambition was to stand out in the competitive co-living market by appealing to young professionals who value design, community, and purpose. They needed:

1. A **memorable logo** that encapsulated their values of openness, connection, and ambition.
2. A **brand identity** that reflected their adventurous and ambitious target demographic.
3. A **website** that served as both a marketing tool and a platform for seamless bookings and inquiries.

## Our Approach

At AE Studios, we believe in combining technical expertise with creative insight. For Narastay, we focused on crafting a brand that was as functional as it was visually compelling.

### Logo Design: The Story of Water and Connection

Narastay’s name is rooted in the word "Nara," meaning water. Inspired by this, we designed a logo featuring a sleek, modern water droplet motif. The droplet is split into two parts—symbolizing individuals and communities coming together, a core value of Narastay. The logo’s minimalist design ensures versatility across digital and physical media.

### Brand Identity: Visuals that Speak to Ambition

We extended the logo’s concept into a full branding suite. This included:
- **Color Palette**: A calming blue to symbolize trust and water, balanced with vibrant tones to reflect ambition and energy.
- **Typography**: Bold, clean fonts that echo Narastay’s modern and professional ethos.
- **Visual Style**: A focus on connection, with images and layouts designed to inspire a sense of community.

### Web Design: Where Form Meets Function

The Narastay website was developed with a user-first approach:
- **Ease of Navigation**: The website uses clean layouts and intuitive navigation to help users explore offerings effortlessly.
- **Smart Features**: Integrated booking forms and event calendars make it easy for users to engage with Narastay’s community and services.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for all devices to provide a seamless experience for digital nomads on the move.

Our development team utilized cutting-edge tools to ensure the site was fast, scalable, and easy to maintain, giving Narastay a digital presence as innovative as their brand.

## The Results

The collaboration between Narastay and AE Studios led to a cohesive brand identity and an engaging digital platform that set them apart in the co-living market. Key outcomes included:

- **Increased Engagement**: A 45% uptick in website visits and inquiries within the first month.
- **Positive Feedback**: Residents and partners praised the modern and welcoming aesthetic of the brand and website.
- **Scalable Design**: A foundation that will grow with Narastay as they expand their offerings.

## Conclusion

Narastay’s journey from vision to reality showcases the power of thoughtful design and strategic development. At AE Studios, we are proud to have played a role in crafting a brand and platform that reflects their values and ambitions.
