## **Introduction**

MeetHub was built to address a common frustration among event organizers: the reliance on third-party platforms for ticketing, RSVPs, and check-ins. These platforms often charge significant fees, limit customization, and redirect attendees away from the organizer’s own brand experience. DAED set out to develop a solution that allows event hosts to maintain full control over their events while eliminating unnecessary costs.

## **The Problem**

Event organizers frequently struggle with the constraints of third-party event management platforms:

- **High Platform Fees** – A percentage of every ticket sale is lost to the hosting platform.
- **Lack of Branding Control** – Attendees are often redirected to external platforms, breaking brand consistency.
- **Limited Customization** – Hosts must operate within the rigid frameworks of third-party services.
- **Fragmented Event Management** – Selling tickets, tracking RSVPs, and managing check-ins often require multiple tools.

These pain points led DAED to develop a more efficient, integrated solution.
