## The Challenge


1. **A compelling project showcase** – Their **portfolio of restored buildings** needed a structured, visually-driven way to tell the story of each transformation.
2. **A refined digital identity** – The website had to **reflect the firm’s design language**, rooted in precision, heritage, and contemporary minimalism.
3. **A user-centric experience** – The firm wanted a website that was **simple, functional, and engaging**, mirroring their architectural philosophy.

### **Project Showcase: Architecture as Storytelling**

A key focus was crafting a **dynamic and structured portfolio** that guides users through each project’s history, challenges, and restoration process.

Key design choices:
- A **warm ochre color palette**, evoking heritage and craftsmanship.
- **Typography-first design**, using clean, bold fonts that emphasize structure and clarity.
- **Grid layout** elements, creating a sense of structure and control.

The result is a **website that feels as intentional as ALT+’s architectural work**, embodying their balance of **preservation and innovation**.
