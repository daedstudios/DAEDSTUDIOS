## Introduction  
ROUGE Amsterdam is a techno club known for its raw energy and underground spirit. With a strong identity but an outdated digital presence, the club needed a modern, immersive website that reflects its brand and allows for seamless event management.  


## The Challenge  
- No dedicated platform for ticket sales, relying on third-party solutions with high fees.  
- A fragmented brand presence with no centralized hub for event listings, galleries, and community interaction.  
- An outdated, static website lacking the dynamic feel of the club’s identity.

## The Solution  
We developed a fully customized **Next.js** website integrated with **Meethub**, our in-house event ticketing system. This allowed ROUGE to:  
- Sell tickets directly, avoiding third-party fees.  
- Manage RSVP tracking and guest lists from a single dashboard.  
- Maintain brand consistency with a bold, immersive UI that aligns with ROUGE’s identity.

## Features & Implementation  
- **Custom Typography & Branding:** A dark, high-contrast UI with monospaced typography to enhance the underground aesthetic.  
- **Event Management Dashboard:** Hosts can create, track, and manage upcoming events effortlessly.  
- **Direct Ticket Sales:** Eliminates the need for external ticketing platforms, ensuring higher revenue retention.
